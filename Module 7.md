```
#include <stdio.h>

struct eligible {
    int age;
    char n[50];
};

int main() {
    struct eligible e;   // variable of structure

    // Input
    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", e.n);

    printf("Enter age: ");
    scanf("%d", &e.age);

    // Eligibility Check
    if (e.age <= 6) {
        printf("Vaccine Eligibility: No\n");
    } else {
        printf("Vaccine Eligibility: Yes\n");
    }

    // Print details

4.	End the main function.
5.	Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.
 
Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *p;
    char name[50];

    printf("Enter the file name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);

    printf("File '%s' created successfully.\n", name);

    p = fopen(name, "w");
    if (p == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("File opened successfully.\n");

    fclose(p);
    printf("File closed.\n");

    return 0;
}

Ex No 5 : C PROGRAM TO DISPLAY STUDENT DETAILS USING STRUCTURE

Aim:
The aim of this program is to dynamically allocate memory to store information about multiple subjects (name and marks), input the details for each subject, and then display the stored information. Finally, it frees the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

Algorithm:
1.Input the number of subjects.

2.Read the integer value n from the user, which represents the number of subjects.

3.Dynamically allocate memory:

4.Use malloc to allocate memory for n subjects. Each subject has a name (array of characters) and marks (integer).

5.If memory allocation fails (i.e., the pointer s is NULL), display an error message and exit the program.

6.Input the details of each subject

7.Use a for loop to read the name and marks of each subject using scanf. For each subject, store the name as a string and marks as an integer in the dynamically allocated memory.

8.Display the details of each subject

9.Use another for loop to print the name and marks of each subject.

10.Free the allocated memory

11.After all operations are done, call free(s) to release the dynamically allocated memory.

12.Return from the main function

13.End the program by returning 0.

Program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct student {
    char name[50];
    int marks;
};

int main() {
    int n, i;
    struct student *s;

    printf("Enter number of subjects: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    s = (struct student*) malloc(n * sizeof(struct student));
    if (s == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Enter subject name: ");
        scanf("%s", s[i].name);
        printf("Enter marks: ");
        scanf("%d", &s[i].marks);
    }

    printf("\nStudent Details:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Subject: %s, Marks: %d\n", s[i].name, s[i].marks);
    }

    free(s);

    return 0;
}

```
